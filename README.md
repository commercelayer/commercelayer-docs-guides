# Intro

Need to fetch prices and inventory, manage shopping carts, customer accounts, or checkout orders? This collection of guides and step-by-step tutorials is what you need, featuring how-tos, handy examples, and best practices for the most common scenarios.

## How it works

Each guide roughly follows the same schema and is developed across four main sections:

1. **Problem** A presentation of the issue you are facing.
2. **Solution** The recommended way to solve the problem. This is where you find the API calls you need to make, along with request/response detailed examples.
3. **Additional notes** A special focus and some highlights of critical aspects around the topic, best practices, suggestions and more in-depth information.
4. **More to read** Links to the API reference, articles, blog posts, or any other resource that can help you getting more information about the subject.
