# Manual payments

Besides being integrated with the most common payment gateways, Commerce Layer offers the possibility to use a **manual gateway**, useful to process wire transfers, cash payments, and other kinds of manual payments.

Creating a manual payment gateway is quite easy: just choose a meaningful name that helps you identify the gateway within your organization and flag the "Require capture before shipping" checkbox in case you want to start fulfilling orders only once the manual payment is captured.

This section will walk you through the steps you need to follow in order to let your customers process their payments using a manual gateway on our platform.
